I am an aspiring web developer located in Brisbane, Australia. I have long had a passion 
for computing and the web so I have decided to turn that into a career.

# Skills
I am comfortable working with:
- Java EE
- Spring Boot
- JPA
- SQL
- Docker
- Linux
- Git
- Bootstrap

My focus is on web application development and will be expanding my skillset to include
JavaScript for front and back-end development.
